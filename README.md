Detecting network intrusions is an imperative part of the modern cybersecurity landscape. Over the years, researchers have leveraged the ability of Machine Learn- ing (ML) to identify and prevent these attacks. Recently there has been an increased interest in the applicability of Deep Learning (DL) in the network intrusion de- tection domain. However, these DL-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems are being proposed and evaluated using outdated datasets which are not repre- sentative of real-world network traffic. By performing a comparative analysis of five popular DL approaches on both a legacy and a modern dataset, this research aims to establish a new baseline for future research in the application of DL for network intrusion detection and provide deeper insights into the performance of these models in detecting and classifying network intrusions.
